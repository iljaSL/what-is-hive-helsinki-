<h3>First of all, what is the 42 Network?</h3>

42 is the first tuition-free computer training, open to all, regardless of diploma and age. Its education is based on  peer-to-peer  learning:  participatory,  no  classes,  no  professors,  all  this  lets  the  students  fully  express  their creativity  thanks  to  learning  based  on  project  completion.  42  was  founded  by  Xavier  Niel  in  2013  when  the computer industry was hit by a major shortage of developers. To train in numbers the best talents of tomorrow, regardless of their origin, 42 is deploying internationally and, within its 42 Network, is part of a group of partner campuses (France, Belgium, Morocco, Finland, Netherlands, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Armenia, Japan, Colombia, Spain, Canada).

<h3>How does the 42 program looks like?</h3>

The   42  program  is  a  college-level  software  engineering  or  coding  program  in  a  professional  environment.  There  are  no  classes,  teachers, or courses: we use project-based learning, skills mastery, peer-to-peer correction to foster learning. Major learning milestones are expressed as levels of experience rather than years; your individual experience sets the pace for learning – not the administrative calendar.

<h3>The 42 curriculum.</h3>

The  heart  of  42  is  code.  Software  development  is  the  driving  engine  of  all  digital  activity.  Students  develop  fundamental  technical  competencies which gives them indispensable adaptability skills necessary for integration into the digital workforce. These technical competencies  ultimately  allow  students  to  comprehend  any  programming  language  and  develop  his  or  her  own  understanding  of  programming paradigms.Students control what they learn, when they learn, and how they learn with the 42 program. They learn at their own pace and can pursue the following main branches of our curriculum: design/web/graphics, algorithms, system programming, mobile development, security or networks.

<h3>The skill tree:</h3>

A company’s capacity to innovate is a fundamental factor in today’s digital market. 42 learners must be able to adapt, to think differently, in order to propose innovative solutions.  Curriculum  projects  are  specifically  designed  to  develop  this  skill,  while  others, through their dynamism or new technologies, naturally have this state of mind.
Rather than a series of languages and specific technologies, 42’s program follows a logical sequence of 17 long-lasting skills. These skills also have the same fundamental element:  personal  adaptability,  learning,  coping  and  solving  new  challenges  that  they will inevitably face regularly. Even if it has a few obligatory paths, 42’s program is individually tailored throughout.
